Mile 2347.5 -> Mile 2384.8

Today was difficult, and long, and hot. As I'm writing this ready to go to bed, I can't think of anything particularly exciting about today. It was just difficult, long, and hot. My shirt is still soaked from sweat and powdery from all the salt I sweat out earlier. It's gross, but I'm so close to finishing to really care. As of tomorrow I'll have less than 250 miles to go. 

Tomorrow I'm heading into Snoqualmie to resupply and eat copious amounts of food. One place called Aardvark Express serves a hiker size portion of curry that fellow hikers have been raving about for some time. I'm super excited to try it.

Here are some photos from the day. Oh, and the mice kept me up damn near all night but they didn't get into any of our stuff.
