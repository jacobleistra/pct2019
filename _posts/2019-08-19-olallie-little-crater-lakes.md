Mile 2040.6 -> Mile 2080.8

If I can help it, today was my last 40 mile day. Not that I don't wabt to crush miles, but I've been jamming through Oregon to get to Washington and I want to enjoy the end. Plus, it's wrecking my legs to go this far each day--especially consecutively. But I'm now two sub-40 mile days from bthe Oregon/Washington border, and I expect bto be drinking a beer in Cascade Locks, OR on Wednesday night.

Today was a big day of necessity: I wanted to set myself up for the Timberline Lodge lunch buffet tomorrow, and I want to get as close as I can to the border to make the next two days mellow(er). And luckily the terrain was *easy* today. It was mostly flat/downhill. 

I got to see two of my favorite Oregon sights so far: Olallie Lake, and Little Crater Lake. 

Olallie Lake is an actual lake with a small resort. Since it's 0.1 miles off trail, I had to swing by the store and get something. I had to. There was surprisingly a big selection--enough for me to resupply off of--but it was all marked up 100-200%. This is understandable, since we're in the middle of nowhere. I only wanted to spend $5 since I had enough food already. I made the choice to get a small pack of Oreos, a theater box of candy, and a protein bar. (I could have gotten a whole tray of Oreos for the same price, and I kinda regret not doing it.)

The lake itself is the idyllic image of a cute lake at the base of a mountain. It's just gorgeous. 

I got out of there soon to tackle my big day ahead, and after many uneventful miles I finished my day near Little Crater Lake. The photos don't do it justice. The water was **so blue** and clear. You could see 45 ft. straight to the bottom. It was gorgeous.

Now I'm cowboy camping for the second night in a row (hooray for no mosquitoes!) on an abandoned dirt road. I actually got into camp with daylight to spare, and I hope that trend continues. Tomorrow: getting $100 worth of a $25 lunch buffet.
