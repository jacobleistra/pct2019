Mile 1999.2 -> Mile 2040.6

Today was another big, long day of hiking. I got probably the best views today of Oregon so far, but today's terrain was the most challenging Oregon has thrown at me so far.

I spent the majority of the day in Mt. Jefferson Wilderness and hiking within sight of the mountain.

Tomorrow is Olallie Lake, the day after is Timberline Lodge, and the day after is Cascade Locks (the last mile of Oregon). I'm ready to rest and take it easy, but I can do that when I'm dead.
