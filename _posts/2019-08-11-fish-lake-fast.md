Roadwalk from Green Springs Inn -> Mile 1735.5 -> Mile 1773.2 -> Side trail to and from Fish Lake Resort -> Mile 1773.6

I left Green Springs Inn early in the morning and walked back to the trail amongst the fog. This is the Oregon I remembered.

Because my schedule was all thrown off, I need to make it to Fish Lake Resort in about 38+ miles in order to resupply food. As I started hiking I checked their hours and realized they closed at 7. It was about 7 AM when I noticed this and I had 37 miles to go. This meant that I had to carry a 3 mph. pace all day and not let up. In Oregon this seemed doable, but if I was in the Sierra I knew I wouldn't make it.

I spent the day jamming down the trail in hopes of getting to Fish Lake for resupply and a meal. It was a pretty uneventful day with two exceptions: I saw a lot of volcanic rock that was made into a trail, and then I saw what the source of the rock was. Toward the end of the day I saw Mt. McLoughlin looming ahead of me. It was the first mountain (like, *mountain* mountain) I had seen in a long time with no snow on it. Pretty cool and surprisingly striking.

I arrived at the side trail to Fish Lake just before 6 PM, and I got to the resort a bit after that. I resupplied for a day or so, ate a great burger, and made my way out of the resort. I'm really glad I made it before they closed, since that means I can hike out tonight and not wait for them to open tomorrow.

I ended my day near a raging creek with great camp sites. As I started to write this post, I realized that my day count was off, and it was in fact the 93rd day of my trip. Until I can get to a computer to fix the numbers, I'm just going to leave them as is and start counting correctly. 

Tomorrow is day 94.
