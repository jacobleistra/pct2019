Hitchhike out of Burney -> Mile 1411.3 -> Mile 1443.0

I woke early but rested. As much as I like sleeping under the stars, it's nice not to worry about mosquitoes or rustling branches. I headed straight to Anna's Country Kitchen across the street for a Denver omelet and some coffee. It was one of the best breakfasts on trail, surprisingly enough. The omelet was like an egg crepe with perfectly grilled peppers and onions inside, and the country potatoes were plentiful and seasoned with a light almost Cajun seasoning. It made me miss Old Bay seasoning.

After packing up, I got a hitch pretty quickly and was on trail by 7:30 AM. Today I was shooting for 39+ miles in addition to checking out Burney Falls.

To be honest, the day was really mellow and unremarkable. I'm getting the idea that NorCal is going to be that way until Oregon, and maybe Oregon will be that way as well.

But Burney Falls was not unremarkable. It was gorgeous and the highlight of the day, far and away. I took the Falls Trail to circle the falls and was graced with some gorgeous views. As I walked closer to the falls I could feel the mist cooling my face and exposed legs (did I mention I got new absurdly short shorts?). There were only a few others around and everything was perfect for a moment.

The rest of the day wasn't nearly as cool, bit I did get to see Mt. Shasta in the distance. It's quite striking due to its surroundings.
