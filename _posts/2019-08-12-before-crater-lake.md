Mile 1773.6 -> Mile 1814.0

After making it to Fish Lake and getting ready for Crater Lake, I was feeling good. Today was just a big day of hiking so I could get into Crater Lake tomorrow for resupply and breakfast.

Today took me through a lot of burn area. I had mixed feelings about the terrain. On one hand, I was up close with how devastating fires can be to outdoor recreation area. It's entirely possible that some of the burn area was caused by human negligence. On the other hand, the burned trees had their own type of beauty, and they gave way to saplings and new trees to repopulate the area.

Something about the circle of life, Lion King, blah blah blah. Which reminds me, I have to go see the new movie when I'm done.

I hiked hard to hit my target campsite and setup after sundown. My feet were killing me, and tomorrow is a big day as well, but I get to eat a real meal and see Crater Lake. It's like a hiking field trip!
