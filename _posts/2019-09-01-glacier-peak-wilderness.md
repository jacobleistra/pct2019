Mile 2479.1 -> 2514.9

Hiking in Washington feels like racing against the clock. Not just on the large scale, where I'm hiking to meet a goal and complete the trail. But on the day to day level. Here's what I mean: there's roughly 14 hours of daylight right now, which means I have 12 hours to spend hiking and 2 hours to spend doing everything else. Everything else ends up being taking breaks, collecting water, and of course setting up/breaking down camp.

The 12 hours for hiking ends up limiting how far I can go and what I can do. I spend the majority of the day jamming through the trail and soaking up the sights. But by now I'm beaten up and tired, and ready for a break. Just a bit more racing to go.

Other than my gripes on being tired and time-deprived, I'm so grateful to be in Washington. It is beyond gorgeous. Today I hiked up and down through Glacier Peak Wilderness. I may even like this area more than Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the section from Snoqualmie Pass to Stevens Pass. The day hurt and wore on me, but it was too spectacular to worry much. I can see why there were a million day/overnight hikers out here.

I also saw Thomas (now "Stress") from Germany. I hadn't seen him since the middle of Southern California, so it was a nice surprise.

I wonder if I'll see anyone else I know in the remaining days.
