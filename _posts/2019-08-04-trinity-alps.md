Mile 1549.7 -> Mile 1586.1

I have heard of Trinity Alps for years but never hiker here. Today was the day I did, and I loved it. But it was surprisingly hard.

All day was up-and-down-and-up-and-down and so on. There wasn't a huge amount of altitude gain, but the constantly changing elevation was enoy to kick my ads. I still was able to get 36ish miles to set myself up for Etna tomorrow.

This area reminds me of the Northern Sierra, but it's also different in some ways. I can't out my finger on it. There's a lot of granite, but there's a lot of pine tree forests. Where the Sierra had forests of pine, this section of NorCal has entire mountainsides of pine reaching as far as you can see.

Needless to say, the air out here is the purest I've ever breathed.
