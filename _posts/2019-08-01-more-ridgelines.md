Mile 1443.0 -> Mile 1479.3

Today I saw my first patch of snow in, what, 3 days? 4? It was a surprising sight but luckily it was off trail and solo.

(My thoughts, but someone else's words.)

The rest of the day was relaxed and rolling through ridgelines. I feel like I'm riding one long ridgeline all the way to Seiad Valley, and maybe even Oregon.

I did cross a really cool bridge over McCloud River. As a lifelong Star Fox fan, I had to stop and put my feet in the river. Unfortunately it's a pretty nasty river, at least near the shore I was at.

Tomorrow is resupply day, which is always fun. I'll be heading to a convenience store in Castella for resupply goodies and a deli sandwich or two.
