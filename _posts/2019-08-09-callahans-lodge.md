Mile 1700.8 -> Mile 1731.9

Oregon has been similar to NorCal so far. It's beautiful, and pretty green, but it's familiar.

Today I'm heading to Callahan's Lodge off I-5, just south of Ashland. It's my first "town" stop in Oregon. Normally I'd skip a stop like Callahan's since it's just a restaurant with an overpriced PCT hiker service package (camping, laundry, shower, for $65). But rumor is they give you a free pint of beer, and the food is supposed to be good. I'm running low on food and will need to resupply at the next lake resort I cross (which will be many in Oregon). A beer and a meal sounds like just the thing!

I saw quite a few hikers at Callahan's as it's a popular spot to hitch into Ashland. I don't want to slow down and get sucked into a town, so I'm skipping Ashland. I had a solid burger and winter ale at Callahan's and got back on the trail by 2 PM.

The trail leaves Callahan's on on Old 99 across I-5. It was weird being around such constant traffic for the first time in a while. As I started hiking I saw the weather was looking pretty nasty. With my intermittent mobile reception I confirmed my worries: chances of thunderstorms tonight and tomorrow.

I passed by Pilot Rock and considered taking the short trail up there. But high places and thunderstorms aren't the best combo, so I passed.

The intermittent rain stopped my hiking early so I could setup my tarp. It was my first time setting up the new tarp and I think I did a decent job, but I don't know the quirks of it yet. I guess I'll find out in the middle of the night, or in the morning! For now, I'm nestled underneath as the light rain patters above my head.
