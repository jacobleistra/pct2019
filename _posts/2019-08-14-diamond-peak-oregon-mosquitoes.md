Mile 1853.9 -> Mile 1894.8

After Crater Lake I had one big day of hiking ahead of me, and then a few more miles into Shelter Cove for my next resupply. Today was spent jamming through woods and hills while getting assaulted by mosquitoes.

Nothing of much note today but a lot of easy hiking and pleasant sights in the Diamond Peak Wilderness.
