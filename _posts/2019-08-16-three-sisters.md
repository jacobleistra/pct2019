Mile 1927.9 -> Mile 1967.9

This was a long but gorgeous day. I'm order to get myself in position to get to Big Lake tomorrow evening, I needed to do a 40 today. The day started off mellow and kinda unremarkable. Towards the second half of the day I entered Three Sisters Wilderness and got some amazing views.
