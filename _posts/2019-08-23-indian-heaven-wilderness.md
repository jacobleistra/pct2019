Mile 2182.6 -> Mile 2219.2

Washington is starting to get really cool. After a solid night's rest, I began a gnarly climb. It was something like 3000 ft. of elevation gain over 9.4 miles. That's really not too steep overall--but the constant uphill was tiresome in the morning. Oh well, that's what Washington is gonna be like.

After getting to my day's cruising altitude I passed a trailhead and parking lot to see some trail magic. Cowboy, a retired union electric worker from Washington, was slinging pancakes, coffee, and other goodies. He'd been there for several days and was staying through the weekend. I chatted with him and a few other hikers and he's a truly great guy--and he makes a mean pancake.

After pigging out for an hour I was on my way to continue the up and down that the rest of my day would consist of. I entered Indian Heaven Wilderness and caught my first glimpse of Mt. Adams, a very welcome sight. Indian Heaven was peaceful and gorgeous, from its trees to its lakes.

Shortly before exiting the wilderness and beginning to descend to where I'd camp, I passed another trailhead to see another trail angel doing trail magic. This time Farmer Tom had a full taco bar setup. I had three crunchy tacos complete with tomatillo salsa and Valentina's hot sauce. What a treat!

My legs were doing good all day but the last four miles were tough on them. I strolled into the campsite to find several section/overnight hikers already setup. After asking to see if I could join their campsite, one guy with a case of Rolling Rock beers asked if I wanted one. It turns out he was a local that does regular trail magic in the area. 

So it was a great day for me and getting spoiled in Washington.
