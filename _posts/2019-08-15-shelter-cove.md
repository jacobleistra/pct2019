Mile 1894.8 -> Mile 1906.6 -> Road walk in and out of Shelter Cove -> Mile 1927.9

I got into Shelter Cove around 10 AM after passing by Slim Jim. I haven't seen him since Bishop, which was my first resupply in the Sierra. We caught up for a bit before I got into Shelter Cove with an empty stomach. They weren't doing real meals until 11, so I charged up my phone and bought food for the next two days. 

I bought my resupply and ordered a blue cheese burger. I probably bought too much food, and I'm probably eating too much, but I can't seem to help it. My stomach seems bottomless at times.

The rest of the day was spent cruising through lakeside trails and familiar Oregon greenery.
