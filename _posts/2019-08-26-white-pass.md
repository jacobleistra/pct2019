Mile 2285.2 -> Mile 2295.4 -> Road walk to and from the White Pass Kracker Barrell -> Mile 2316.2

It was a cold night and as soon I was fully awake I realized why: I was hitnhard with condensation and my quilt was very wet. Oh well, I had to get to White Pass to resupply and I could dry my stuff out there.

The morning hike was pretty chill with a mix of woods, ridgelines, and rocks.

As I was descending to White Pass, a hiker was going uphill and I recognized him right away. Second Chance Hiker, a famous YouTuber, was slackpacking and headed towards to Goat Rocks to meet up with his girlfriend. We chatted for about 15 minutes about everything from craving salads on trail to Wayne's World. He was as delightful as he seems in his YouTube videos. He asked me, "Did you go through the Sierra? You look like a hiker that did the Sierras." I took that as a compliment, but considering how gross I looked/felt, I'm sure it could be a humourous insult as well.

As we said goodbye, he gave me an unexpected hug. He was a pleasure to talk to and I can see why he has a reputation for being a positive guy.

I got to Kracker Barrell, which is just a gas station and convenience store near the trail. I spent $45 on a few days of food, an ice cream bar, a tall beer, and a few hot food items.

The rest of the day was pretty mellow until I got to my campsite. I had a stunning sunset view of Mt. Rainier all to myself for a while. A couple other hikers showed up later but they were friendly and we chatted for a while.
