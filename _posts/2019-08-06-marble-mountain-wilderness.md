Hitchhike out of Etna -> Mile 1599.7 -> Mile 1625.5

Today was probably my first bad day on trail. I guess that's good I got almost 90 days, but it was still a sucky feeling. It was the first day in a long time that I didn't feel I had fun hiking.

I woke up early and got coffee and a breakfast burrito from a local spot. Everything was great, and I headed back to the R&R Bunkhouse to pack up. I hit the main road around 9:00 AM and three a thumb. After a few miny of no traffic, I decided to walk to the direction of the trail and try to catch a passing car. No one budged, but traffic was very light. I ended up walking almost 3 miles before a nice lady in a truck told me to hop in the truck bed. I'm really glad I was able to get a hitch, but it was still a bit of a drag.

The rest of the day was tough. It was sunny, hot, dry, and everything generally unpleasant when hiking over hills and mountains. At one point I just realized I was over this terrain. I was ready for some easier or just... different.

The rest of the day was a drag. I forgot to put on sunscreen and the shade was fleeting for most of the day. My legs were burned and I was exhausted. I finally stopped at a campsite around 7 PM, which is a bit earli for me. I wanted to get farther since my day into Seiad Valley wasn't going to be easy, but I just had to stop. It was an off day and I didn't want to be hiking.

But when I stopped at camp, I saw where I was, smiled a bit, and started to mellow out. The wisdom among thru hikers is not to dwell on bad days. Let them happen, move past them, and remember that tomorrow is a different day. Hopefully tomorrow goes a bit better.

As I sat eating food and getting ready for bed, I saw a pika eating a wildflower on a log. Damn, those things are cute. Can't be that bad of a day after all.
